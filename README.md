# DNA sequence comparator made with JS 

<p> With this project you can compare two DNA sequences and know the amount of nucleotide bases that are paired </p>

<p> Take the DNA sequence of some gene in text format, copy and paste it in the first form. Then, take the second gene sequence, also, in text format and paste it in the second form. With this, when clicking on the button, the program will compare line by line and will return the number of equal sequences that are in the same position.

Example:
<br> A T G C A T G C A T G <br>
     A T G C A T G C A A C <br>
 We can see that in this sequence there are: 9 identical nucleotide bases. </p>
